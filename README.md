- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Raine (they/them)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Gaming, programming, playing the clarinet, speedcubing
    Some of my favorite games of all time are Hollow Knight, Ori and the Blind Forest/Will of the Wisps, Geometry Dash, Portal 1 and 2, Omori, Undertale, and Celeste. /
    I've been playing the clarinet for 6 years, and I've gotten pretty decent. /
    My 3x3 Rubik's Cube pb single is 7.39 seconds
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of programming, Python, and C#. Most of the programs I will post here for a while will probably be beginner programs mainly for learing these languages and for fun.
